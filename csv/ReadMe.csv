"This Excelfile contains a selection of the variables from the Matlab structure ""MAT_normalizedData_PostStrokeAdults_v27-02-23. ",,
,,
"Each tab is a subject (numbered consistently with the MAT structure), from Sub01 to Sub50.",,
,,
"For each subject, the following variables are given (most commonly used gait parameters): ",,
,"Saggital plane ankle angle, knee angle, hip angle and pelvis angles",
,"EMG of the Gastrocnemius (GAS), Rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosis (ST) and erector spinae (ERS)",
,,normalized to the maximum of each individual's muscle during the gait cycle
,,
,"Note: no ankle/knee/hip moment and powers, or 3D ground reaction forces are given, as not much good GRF data could be captured for the stroke patients.",
,,
,,
,These variables are averaged over the strides for the paretic (Pside) and non-paretic (Nside) separately due to their assymetry.,
,"Each variable has 1001 points, spanning equally across the gait cycle.",
,Events used for the stride time normalization and other data can be found in the original MAT structures.,
